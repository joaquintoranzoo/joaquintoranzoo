## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm 21 years old, I started studying programming back in 2021, I started from the frontend side and today I'm studying programming technology at the national technological university of Argentina. 

I aspire to be a fullstack developer but we are still on the way, life's mishaps...

## ðŸ›  Skills
My current technology stack is still a bit short, but it is as follows: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python and SQL server.

More to come...
